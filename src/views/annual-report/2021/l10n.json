    "annualReport.2021.directorsMessageP1": "In 2021, COVID-19 continued to disrupt our routines and shape the way we interact with one another. Even as we began to gather together, schools reopened, and there were calls for a “return to normal,” the most vulnerable in our society remained disproportionately impacted by the inequitable structures that COVID-19 exacerbated. The COVID-19 crisis shaped young people’s relationships to Scratch, and solidified Scratch as a more vital place than ever for them to create, learn, and connect. But as we moved into a new year, we did not leave behind our most vulnerable young people as they began to navigate “the new normal.”",
    "annualReport.2021.directorsMessageP2": "One of the foundational values of Scratch has always been to empower young people to explore, create, play, and discover—opportunities that aren’t afforded equitably to all students.",
    "annualReport.2021.directorsMessagePullquote": "We believe in the transformative power of self-expression and creativity, and in providing space for young people to use creative coding as a tool to raise their voice.",
    "annualReport.2021.directorsMessageP3": "I’m proud to serve as the Executive Director of the Scratch Foundation during this pivotal moment in our history, and will continue to spread Scratch’s caring, collaborative approach to creative learning to kids around the world who need these opportunities the most.",
    "annualReport.2021.directorsMessageP4": "Last year was an incredible year for the Scratch Foundation–we focused on growing our team with remarkable, diverse leaders and building a solid foundation for our continued transition to an independent organization. We developed a three-year Strategic Plan with the combined efforts of every team member at every level of our organization, codifying the work we’re embarking on together. As Scratch grows, we remain focused on equity and community-building, and keeping Scratch a safe space for kids to connect, create, and collaborate with their peers around the world.",
    "annualReport.2021.directorsMessageP5": "LI can’t thank you enough for embarking on this journey with our team, and for your continued support of our mission. The compassion and creativity of the Scratch Community is endlessly inspiring to us, and we can’t wait for you to join us in the important work ahead of us.",
    "annualReport.2021.directorsMessageP6": "Over the past decade, Scratch has had phenomenal success, engaging tens of millions of young people around the world. But we are just beginning. The challenge for the years ahead is to ensure that we can continue to spread and support not just our technology but also our creative, caring, collaborative learning approach, so that young people around the world have equitable opportunities to imagine, create, share, and learn. We look forward to working with all of you to make that happen!",

With support from Google.org, we’ve launched the Scratch Education Collaborative (SEC), a powerful network of organizations across the world focused on supporting these learners in developing their confidence in creative computing. The 41 organizations in year one of the new program will connect with and learn from the Scratch Team and one another, and develop Equity Toolkits that will support them as they grow and scale their support for the learners in their community.",

Until then, I’d like to extend my sincere appreciation to the Scratch Community for continuing to support and care for each other through a turbulent year.
